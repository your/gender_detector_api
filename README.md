# gender_detector_api

API-only Rails app providing fast gender names resolution.

**Production-ready.** (switch to the `heroku-config` branch)


## Dependencies

The [gender_detector](https://github.com/bmuller/gender_detector) gem is used to process the gender.


## Config

### Defaults

Change `DEFAULT_COUNTRY` and `FALLBACK_GENDER` in [`app/config/initializers/gender_detector.rb`](../master/config/initializers/gender_detector.rb)

(default gender is `f`.. you know.. :))


### Auth

Add/replace auth tokens in [`app/config/auth.yml`](../master/config/auth.yml)
(or implement your own authentication logic)

## Test it

* Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/gender.json`
* Mandatory params: `list`
* Optional fields: `country`

### Example
**Request:**

```
POST /api/v1/gender.json
{
  "names": {
    "country": "italy",
    "list": ["Giuseppe", "Sara", "Clara"]
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```
200 OK
{
  "names": {
    "country": "italy",
    "list": [
      {
        "name": "Giuseppe",
        "gender": "m"
      },
      {
        "name": "Sara",
        "gender": "f"
      },
        "name": "Clara",
        "gender": "f"
    ]
  }
}
```

Unathorized calls or with wrong paramters will receive a `403 Unauthorized` and `400 Bad Request` status with a blank body respectively.
